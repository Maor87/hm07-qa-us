# Urban Grocers (TripleTen Bootcamp Project)

# Description: 
Writing test scripts using HTTP: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, to checking info for testing of Urban Grocers items. 
The purpose of the project is to test certain aspects of the Urban Grocers warehouse items using HTTP methods 
for different tasks.

# Technologies:
1. **Javascript**: used in test scripts to write and execute test cases, handle asynchronous operations.
2. **Jest**: is a JavaScript testing framework used to write, run, and structure tests.
3. **Visual Studio Code**: is a powerful and lightweight code editor used for writing, debugging, and managing 
                           JavaScript test scripts.
4. **Node.JS**: a JavaScript runtime used to execute test scripts on the server-side, enabling asynchronous testing 
                and integration with various testing frameworks like Jest.
5. **GIT**: version control system used to track changes in the codebase, and collaborate with team members on      
            test scripts and other project files.
6. **Github**: web-based platform that hosts Git repositories, collaboration and sharing of test scripts and project 
               files among QA's.
7. **JSON**: is a lightweight data interchange format used to structure data in test scripts, making it easy to read 
             and write API requests and responses.

8. **Postman**: a tool used to test APIs by making HTTP requests and verifying responses, the creation and validation 
                of test scripts.

# How to Run the Tests, Commandline: 
**Step 1**: npm install "used to install the dependencies listed in a project's `package.json`"
**Step 2**: install jest "to install the testing framework of jest"
**Step 3**: npx jest "to run the tests of the code"
